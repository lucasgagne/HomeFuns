#This project includes tic-tac-toememo which is a file that allows users to play against a CPU, solve for all possible positions in a Tic Tac Toe game 
#to determine all wins, losses, and ties. The other files include the "10-0" game which is a variation of the "Nim" game. the solver will solve all 
#Possible outcomes of the game, and it will memoize solutions, as well as track "remoteness" which tracks how far from a win/ loss the position is located.
